<p><span class="h3">Nathan</span> is a northwest soul. Growing up on the Olympic Peninsula he found himself drawn to hobbies that put his feet in the water and his hands in the soil. From these experiences a deep passion for “food with integrity” was born. He takes great joy in curating a memorable flavor experience through sourcing local products from his friends in the market as well as directly from local fisherman and farmers.</p>
